This project explores a large healthcare procedure dataset (~47,000+ rows) to uncover patterns in procedure costs, duration, and patient demographics using both Excel (Pivot Tables, formulas, charts) and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib). Data is open source hospital procedures data from Massachussets General Hospital (2011-2022) on MavenAnalytics.com.
